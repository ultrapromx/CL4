Creating a Database:
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS example_db;
USE example_db;

Creating a Table:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
    id INT,
    name STRING,
    age INT,
    salary FLOAT
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;

Creating a Partitioned Table:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE employees_partitioned (
    name STRING,
    age INT,
    salary FLOAT
)
PARTITIONED BY (id INT)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;

Adding Data to a Partition:
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/path/to/data.csv' INTO TABLE employees_partitioned PARTITION (id=1);


4. Hive Built-in Functions and Operators
Hive supports numerous built-in functions and operators for operations like mathematical calculations, string handling, date manipulation, and more.

Example Functions:
Mathematical: ROUND(), CEIL(), FLOOR()
String: CONCAT(), SUBSTR(), LENGTH()
Date: TO_DATE(), YEAR(), DATEDIFF()
Operators: Hive supports standard operators such as =, <>, >, <, >=, <=, AND, OR, and NOT.
5. Hive Views
Views in Hive are virtual tables based on the result-set of an SQL statement. They are used to simplify complex queries.

Creating a View:
sql
Copy code
CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS emp_view AS
SELECT name, age FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
6. Hive Indexes
Indexes in Hive help speed up query processing on certain columns of a Hive table.

Creating an Index:
sql
Copy code
CREATE INDEX idx_salary ON TABLE employees (salary)
AS 'COMPACT'
WITH DEFERRED REBUILD;
Rebuilding an Index:
sql
Copy code
ALTER INDEX idx_salary ON employees REBUILD;
Dropping an Index:
sql
Copy code
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_salary ON employees;
